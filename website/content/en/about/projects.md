TAG Environmental Sustainability has projects to collaborate and coordinate efforts towards achieving common goals and objectives, as well as to distribute tasks and responsibilities among its members for efficient execution. Smaller scoped initiatives, which are completed once the deliverables are met, do not require the formation of a working group and instead are formed as a project.
All completed, in progress or cancelled projects are listed here. Details for each project are available on the [repository](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/tree/main/projects).
